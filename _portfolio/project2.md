## Explanation

BlocChat is a chatroom application that can send and receive messages in real time. I created it using AngularJS and Firebase. This project allowed me to practice Angular concepts that proved to be quite difficult to understand, such as controllers and services. Modals were used to create information stored into cookies, which were then pulled from the Firebase database to display the username, available chatrooms, and chatlog to the user.
