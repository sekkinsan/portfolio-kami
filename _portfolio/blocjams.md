## Explanation

BlocJams was the first project of the front end foundation in the Bloc curriculum that was given. BlocJams is a mini browser based replica of Spotify, that can allow users to select, view, and listen to an album of their choosing. I was able to showcase my basic understanding of core concepts such as HTML, CSS, and DOM Scripting. I then translated vanilla JavaScript to jQuery. Key players of BlocJams were myself and my mentor, William. It was the first encounter I had with JavaScript events, and my first experience creating a webpage.
