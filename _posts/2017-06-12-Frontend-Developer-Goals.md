title: "Goals as a Front-end Developer"

During some moments I imagine myself being able to create stunning websites for friends that are pursuing their passion through entrepreneurship. Other times, I can just see myself working alongside other developers just cranking out a request from a client. My main goal as a front-end developer is to create, design, and create some more. What I want to create however, is something that I still haven’t decided on yet, but there are some rough ideas inside my constantly moving mind.

I want to create a simplistic template that I can call my own that piques the interests of users worldwide, as well as a functioning website or application that is primarily based on the attachments I have in my life. Some of my primary focuses would have to be psychology, video games, and the aggregation of technology. In such constantly developing world, I believe it’s important to keep up, not to be following pace with others, but in order to not be deemed obsolete. As a developer, I understand that some prefer new ideas rather than old one, but I believe that old ideas are not to be taken lightly. Simplicity at its finest is a great design that is every bit as appealing as others in my eyes. A more short term goal I have is to be able to say, “I helped create that!” when there is a new website or application for a startup that has ultimately made a powerful brand name for itself. Or even, to be able to work for a company and help develop something in their team is appealing to me as well.

In the end, I’m also hoping to make a jump forward financially by pursuing web development. It’s a sought after position according to the image listed below, with salaries that seem to fit my taste more so than other vocations… :)
