Bloc Jams Angular

Just completed the initial Angular portion of the Bloc curriculum where I refactor my bloc-jams project using Angular. To be quite honest the whole experience was… difficult and frustrating to say the least. Although that may be a result of myself being a novice in this field, I had hoped for a smoother ride while attempting to absorb all the information that was thrown at me. Angular was the first framework that I had the chance to study, and it made me believe that studying web development is easier for those who just “get it”. I used to be one of those people who just “understood” math easily when learning new concepts, but am not so lucky in these concepts. However that does not mean I will give up! Through the struggle of trying to grasp these concepts over the past two weeks, I think I can say I came out (somewhat) victorious over Angular. There are still bits and pieces that still confuse me a little bit, but with a quick refresher I feel that I’m able to understand everything to a working extent. I think the most difficult concept for me to grasp regarding the Angular framework would have to be directives. Directives bind Angular functionality to HTML on a page, and what made them so difficult to understand was the logic behind the syntax, as well as remembering what each option was meant to do. Another stickler for me were the different types of services, one being called a service service did not make it any easier to understand..

Now it's on to the next project, creating something like a chatroom using Angular once more.

Thanks to learn-angular (http://www.learn-angular.org/) for effective practices with using Angular, it really helped me grasp some of the concepts that I was struggling with. I'll probably have to use it again to review.
